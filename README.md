# Babyjump Mod for Dark Souls II

## Info
This .exe is a simple console application that removes the smaller jumps (babyjumps) from Dark Souls II. On startup you can decide if you only want to remove small jumps from R3 but also from 'circle' jumps.

## Usage
Download and open up [DS2BabyJumpMod.exe](https://github.com/floelm/DS2BabyJumpMod/raw/master/DS2BabyJumpMod.exe). Leave it open in the background. It does not matter whether you open it up before or after starting DS2.
